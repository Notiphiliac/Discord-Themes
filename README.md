	Notiphiliac's (a.k.a. Pastel Love's) Discord Themes
A complete list of themes I've created, including the source code for each of them.
Keep in mind the source of each theme will not update automatically and you will have to either maintain it yourself or update them manually.



	How to download them and get them working:

		▻ Open the raw code, either press Ctrl+S to save it as a file or paste into a text file.
		▻ Make sure that the file is named something like "name.theme.css".
		▻ Open the themes folder:
			Windows: %appdata%/BetterDiscord/themes
			Mac: Library/Preferences/BetterDiscord/themes (may not have full support!)
			Linux: $HOME/.config/BetterDiscord/themes (may not have full support!)
		▻ Drag the theme from your downloads to the folder (or use the mv command on Linux).
    	▻ Turn on the theme in your BetterDiscord's settings!


	If you have an issue with the theme:
		▻ If a part of the theme is left unthemed: 
		    create an issue on the GitHub page or report it on the Discord support server.
		▻ You have a problem with customizing the theme: 
		    open up the theme file to access the customizable variables
		▻ It doesn't support a plugin/theme: 
		    create issue on GitHub page or report in the Discord support server.

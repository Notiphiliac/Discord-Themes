## Previews and Info
### Info
A complete list of themes I've created, including the source code for each of them. They work fine with [BetterDiscord](http://betterdiscord.net), a Discord add-on.

Themes with the prefix "m-" are mini themes and do not alter Discord's appearance significantly. They will modify 1 or 2 parts of Discord.

Keep in mind the source code of each theme will not update automatically and you will have to either maintain it yourself or update them manually. Perhaps someday, plugins will be added onto this list once I feel comfortable enough with JavaScript.

	Please do not pass off my themes as your own work, 
	even if you have modified them slightly or merged it with different themes.

### Previews
There are no previews for themes yet! Once more themes are added, I will eventually add previews and info for each theme.

## Support

## FAQ
	Q: Is Better Discord safe/against TOS? Can I get my account banned for using it?
A: While Better Discord is against Discords Terms of service, Discord has yet to do any action for people solely using themes. There have been instances of people being banned for Plugins such as message logger or self-botting though. 

	Q: How to install Better Discord?
A: Mac and Windows users can get [auto installers](https://github.com/rauenzi/BBDInstaller/releases/latest). Linux users must check out this [gist](https://gist.github.com/ObserverOfTime/d7e60eb9aa7fe837545c8cb77cf31172) to install it. If you need more assistance with that, there are [visual guides](https://0x71.cc/bd/guide/#install).

	Q: Are these themes dangerous? Can they take my information?
A: No, the most I can do with a theme is make your Discord look atrocious.

	Q: Can I customize the theme?
A: Of course you can, there are easily modifiable variables in the main files, which can be changed with any text editor. If you want to change more than that, you will need to learn CSS (Cascading Style Sheet) to modify Discord.

## Previews and Info
### Info
A complete list of themes I've created, including the source code for each of them. They work fine with [BetterDiscord](http://betterdiscord.net), a Discord add-on.

Themes with the prefix "m-" are mini-themes and do not alter Discord's appearance significantly. They will modify 1 or 2 parts of Discord.

Keep in mind the source code of each theme will not update automatically and you will have to either maintain it yourself or update them manually. 
	Please do not pass off my themes as your own work, 
	even if you have modified them slightly or merged it with different themes.

### Previews
There are no previews for themes yet! Once more themes are added, I will eventually add previews and info for each theme.

## Support
Many questions will be answered in [FAQ](https://github.com/Notiphiliac/Discord-Themes/blob/master/README.md#faq), but if there is anything that you still need assistance with feel free to DM me on Discord: @pastellove. 
	If you have an issue with the theme:
		▻ If a part of the theme is left unthemed: 
		    create an issue on the GitHub page or report it to me through DMs.
		▻ You have a problem with customizing the theme: 
		    open up the theme file to access the customizable variables
		▻ It doesn't support a plugin/theme: 
		    create issue on GitHub page or report in DMs.

## FAQ
	Q: Is Better Discord safe/against TOS? Can I get my account banned for using it?
A: While Better Discord is against Discords Terms of service, Discord has yet to do any action for people solely using themes. 

	Q: How to install Better Discord?
A: Download the installer from the [BetterDiscord website](https://betterdiscord.app). There is also a [visual guide](https://docs.betterdiscord.app/users/getting-started/installation)

	Q: Are these themes dangerous? Can they take my information?
A: No, the most I can do with a theme is make your Discord look horrible.

	Q: Can I customize the theme?
A: Of course you can, there are easily modifiable variables in the main files, which can be changed with any text editor. If you want to change more than that, you will need to learn CSS to modify Discord.
